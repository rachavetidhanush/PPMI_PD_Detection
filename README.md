Deep learning models (VGG19, GCN) with Salp Swarm Optimization for Parkinsonâ€™s Disease detection using MRI scans


Parkinson's Disease Detection
This repository implements a machine learning pipeline for detecting Parkinson's disease (PD) using DICOM imaging data from the PPMI dataset. The pipeline employs deep learning (VGG19-based models) and graph-based methods (Graph Convolutional Networks) with Salp Swarm Optimization (SSO) for hyperparameter tuning. This README ensures reproducibility and transparency per the specified format.
Reproducibility
Algorithms and Code Used
The pipeline includes four main scripts for PD detection, leveraging both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs):

vgg19.py (VGG19-based Model):

Purpose: Classifies DICOM images as PD or healthy using a pre-trained VGG19 model.
Steps:
Loads and preprocesses DICOM images (normalize to 0-255, resize to 128x128, convert to 3-channel RGB).
Splits data into train (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets.
Builds a VGG19 model with frozen base layers, adding GlobalAveragePooling2D, Dense (512 units), Dropout (0.5), and softmax output for binary classification.
Trains with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, flip) for 25 epochs, using Adam optimizer (lr=0.0001), categorical crossentropy loss, and callbacks (EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau, ModelCheckpoint).
Evaluates on test set (accuracy, AUC, classification report, confusion matrix).
Visualizes training history, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.


Outputs: parkinson_vgg19_final_model.h5, best_parkinson_model.keras, plots (training_history.png, auc_history.png, confusion_matrix.png, roc_curve.png).


vgg19Sso.py (VGG19 with Salp Swarm Optimization):

Purpose: Optimizes VGG19 hyperparameters using SSO for improved performance.
Steps:
Loads DICOM images in batches, preprocesses similarly to vgg19.py.
Splits data into train (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets with stratification.
Uses SSO to optimize learning rate (1e-5 to 1e-3), dense units (128 to 512), and dropout rate (0.3 to 0.6) over 3 iterations with 5 salps.
Trains a VGG19 model with best hyperparameters, using data augmentation (rotation, zoom, translation) and early stopping (patience=5).
Evaluates on test set (accuracy, AUC, classification report, confusion matrix).
Visualizes training curves, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification metrics.


Outputs: pd_detection_model.h5, plots (training_curves.png, confusion_matrix.png, roc_curve.png, classification_metrics.png).


gcnsso.py (GCN with Salp Swarm Optimization):

Purpose: Uses a GCN to classify PD vs. healthy based on graph-structured data with SSO for hyperparameter tuning.
Steps:
Extracts advanced metadata (e.g., PatientAge, SliceThickness) and image features (e.g., GLCM, pixel statistics) from DICOM files.
Creates a graph using cosine similarity (threshold at 99th percentile) between feature vectors.
Balances PD and healthy samples, applies variance thresholding to features.
Uses SSO to optimize learning rate (0.001 to 0.1) and hidden channels (8 to 64) over 20 iterations.
Trains a GCN with two convolutional layers for 100 epochs with early stopping (patience=20).
Evaluates on test set (accuracy, AUC, classification report).
Visualizes training accuracy.


Outputs: Accuracy and AUC plots (displayed, not saved).


gcn.py (GCN with Image Features):

Purpose: Enhances GCN with traditional image features for improved classification.
Steps:
Extracts metadata (7 features) and traditional image features (64 features, e.g., histogram, Sobel edges, entropy) from DICOM files.
Creates a graph using cosine similarity (threshold at 95th percentile).
Balances dataset, combines metadata and image features.
Trains a GCN with two convolutional layers (metadata_features=7, image_features=64, hidden_channels=64) for 200 epochs with early stopping (patience=20).
Evaluates on test set (accuracy, AUC, classification report, confusion matrix).
Visualizes graph structure, feature importance, node embeddings (t-SNE), training history, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and precision-recall curve.


Outputs: parkinson_gcn_model.pt, plots (graph_structure.png, feature_importance.png, node_embeddings.png, training_history.png, confusion_matrix.png, roc_curve.png, precision_recall_curve.png).

Evaluation Method
Models are evaluated on test sets using:

Primary Metrics: Accuracy and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).
Secondary Metrics: Precision, recall, F1-score (via classification report), confusion matrix.
Process:
VGG19 and VGG19-SSO: Evaluate on test images (15-20% of data) for binary classification (PD vs. healthy).

Conclusions
Limitations

Dataset: The dataset may have selection bias, limiting generalizability to diverse PD populations.
Preprocessing: DICOM image preprocessing (normalization, resizing) may lose fine-grained details critical for diagnosis.
Models:
VGG19 models rely on pre-trained weights, which may not fully adapt to medical imaging.
GCN models depend on graph construction quality (e.g., similarity threshold), which can affect performance.


Compute: GPU is recommended for faster training; local CPU runs may be slow for large datasets.
Evaluation: Focus on binary classification may miss nuanced PD progression stages.
